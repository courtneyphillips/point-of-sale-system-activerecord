#Point of Sale System

---

## Synopsis

This Point of Sale system was built by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneymaepdx) and [Leroi Dejesa](https://github.com/leroidejesa) as part of the Spring 2015 Ruby course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/). It utilizes ActiveRecord to create and maintain a point-of-sale system for a fictional antique shop. It tracks products, and sales, produces receipts, and generates reports depicting sales between given dates.

## Motivation

This project was created as an excercise in integrating [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) one-to-many database relationships in Ruby/Sinatra projects.

## Installation & Setup

#### Gems

The Point of Sale program uses the following gems:

  - Capybara
  - Sinatra
  - RSpec
  - Pry
  - ActiveRecord
  - PG
  - Rake

To install, run `$ gem install bundle` in the terminal.

#### Databases

Additionally, Point of Sale utilizes databases via ActiveRecord. Should you clone this repository, simply do the following to establish and prepare similar databases for your own use:

  1. Launch the Postgres server by running `$ postgres` in the terminal.
  3. Navigate to the project folder and run `$ rake db:create`.
  4. Run `$ rake db:migrate` to migrate the changes detailed in db into the database.

## Tests

Before running any tests requiring databases, run `$ rake db:test:prepare` in the terminal in order to mirror changes from the development database into the test database.

Both method and integration tests for Point of Sale utilize RSpec. Simply run `$ gem install rspec`, if it's not already installed, and then the command `rspec`, while located in the project's file.
