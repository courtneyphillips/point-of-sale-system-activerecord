#Point of Sale System

---

## Synopsis

This Point of Sale system was built by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneymaepdx) and [Leroi Dejesa](https://github.com/leroidejesa) as part of the Spring 2015 Ruby course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/). It utilizes ActiveRecord to create and maintain a point-of-sale system for a fictional antique shop. It tracks products, sales, and generates reports depicting sales between given dates.

## Motivation

This project was created as an excercise in integrating ActiveRecord one-to-many database relationships in Ruby/Sinatra projects.
